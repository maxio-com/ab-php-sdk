     * [reactivation](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252109503629-Reactivating-and-Resuming).
     *
     * **Note: The term "resume" is used also during another process in Advanced Billing. This occurs when
     * an on-hold subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**
     *
     * + The response returns the subscription object in the `active` or `trialing` state.
     * + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values.
     * + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
     * + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".
     *
     * ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription
     *
     * A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing
     * period the subscription was canceled in.
     *
     * A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it
     * does not start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription,
     * depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it
     * was canceled because of dunning).
     *
     * Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription
     * is then canceled on June 15.
     *
     * If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing
     * date of July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.
     *
     * If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing
     * date of July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be
     * reactivated with a new billing period.
     *
     * | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
     * |---|---|---|
     * | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
     * | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |
     *
     * ## Reactivation Scenarios
     *
     * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance
     *
     * + Given you have a product that costs $20
     * + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
     * + 1 charge should exist for $20
     * + 1 payment should exist for $20
     * + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
     * + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
     * + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
     * + Total charges = $40
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     * + The subscription balance will be zero
     *
     * ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon
     *
     * + Given you have a canceled subscription
     * + It has no current period defined
     * + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
     * + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods
     *
     * PUT request sent to:
     * `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     * + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"
     *
     * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag
     *
     * + Given you have a canceled subscription
     * + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
     *
     * + PUT request to
     * `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json`
     *
     *
     * #### Results
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     *
     * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag
     *
     * + Given you have a canceled subscription
     * + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
     *
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * include_trial=1`
     *
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to trialing
     *
     * ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription
     *
     * + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     *
     * ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription
     *
     * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription and it is resumable
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * resume=true`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     * + The next billing date should not have changed
     *
     * ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable
     *
     * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * resume=true`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.
     *
     * ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable
     *
     * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * resume[require_resume]=true`
     * + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
     * + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
     * ```
     * {
     * "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription should remain `canceled`
     * + The next billing date should not have changed
     *
     * ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing
     *
     * + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable
     * + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
     * + And there is still time left on the trial
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * resume=true`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to trialing
     * + The next billing date should not have changed
     *
     * ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended
     *
     * + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable
     * + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?
     * resume=true`
     *
     * #### Results
     *
     * + The subscription will transition to active
     * + The next billing date should not have changed
     * + Any product-related charges should have been collected

    /**
     * The Chargify API allows you to preview a renewal by posting to the renewals endpoint. Renewal
     * Preview is an object representing a subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a
     * snapshot of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal.
     *
     * The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each
     * Subscriber's Summary. For more information, see our documentation [here](https://maxio.zendesk.
     * com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview).
     *
     * ## Optional Component Fields
     *
     * This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will return the computed billing amount
     * for the base product and the components which are in use by a subscriber.
     *
     * By default, the preview will include billing details for all components _at their **current**
     * quantities_. This means:
     *
     * * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components
     * * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
     * * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components
     * * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components
     *
     * In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview
     * endpoint. We do not predict end-of-period values for components, so metered or events-based usage
     * may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period.
     *
     * Optionally, **you may provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing
     * preview for non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under
     * the `components` key. See the request body documentation below.
     *
     * ## Subscription Side Effects
     *
     * You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without any side effects. Plain and
     * simple, this will preview data, not log any changes against a subscription.
     *
     * @param int $subscriptionId The Chargify id of the subscription
     * @param RenewalPreviewRequest|null $body
     *
     * @return RenewalPreviewResponse Response from the API call
     *
     * @throws ApiException Thrown if API call fails
